UWS Library
===========

A Generic UWS library based on the original ideas from the 
[Astrogrid CEA](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/Notes/CEA/CEADesignIVOANote-20050513.html). It was a superset of UWS as explained in the [relationship with UWS](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/IntroductionCEA_UWS.html).

## TODO

* although the bulk of the interfaces has been redesigned to take account modern requirements, 
the parameter handling in org.javastro.ivoacore.uws.environment.parameter is 
taken pretty much as is from the AstroGrid implementation, and as such does probably require some more redesign.
